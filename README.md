# About The Project
  Flappy Bird:
  
    Flappy Bird is a game where you tap the screen to make the bird fly.
    This is a frustrating game to some people,
    as if you hit a pipe, your bird falls and you restart the game.
    However, some people believe that not fully focusing on the game or
    focusing only on the bottom pipe helps you get a higher score.
